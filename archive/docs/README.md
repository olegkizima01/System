# 📦 Archived Documentation

This directory contains documentation that has been archived during refactoring.
These files are kept for historical reference but are no longer actively maintained.

## Contents

## Why Archived?

These documents were consolidated into the main `docs/atlas.md` workflow guide
during the December 2025 refactoring. The information is now available in a
more maintainable, unified format.

## Current Documentation

For up-to-date documentation, see:
- **`docs/atlas.md`** - Main workflow guide and architecture reference
- **`docs/QUICKSTART.md`** - Quick start guide (renamed from TRINITY_IMPROVEMENTS_QUICKSTART.md)
- **`README.md`** - Project overview

## Note

If you need information from these archived files, consider updating the main
documentation instead of referencing the archived versions.
